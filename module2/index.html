<h2 class="first">RED</h2>
<p>Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light,
 next to orange and opposite violet. 
 It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.
 It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, 
 and is the complementary color of cyan. 
 Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson,
 and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy</p>

<h2 class="second">GREEN</h2>
<P>Green is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum.
 It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495–570 nm. 
 In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, 
 it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; 
 in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, 
 it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue,
 which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors.</P>

<h2  class="third" >BLUE</h2>
<P>
Blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments 
in painting and traditional colour theory, 
as well as in the RGB colour model. 
It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. 
The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. 
Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours; azure contains some green,
The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering.
